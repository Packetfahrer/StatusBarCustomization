# StatusBarCustomization

A simple demo of how you can customize the iOS status bar to show a custom time, signal strength, Wi-Fi status, or any other icon that usually appears in the status bar. This is a quick hack that was used for a short demo at [CocoaHeads Boston](http://www.cocoaheadsboston.org).

This works on both the simulator and device. Don't even think about trying to submit this in an App Store build, obviously.

Inspiration and original credit goes to the initial implementation of XCDFakeCarrier (https://gist.github.com/0xced/3035167).
